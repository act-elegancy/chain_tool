# chain_tool
Optimization (MILP) and dynamic simulation frameworks for modelling hydrogen and CO2 process systems

This tool was designed to allow users to design hydrogen and carbon dioxide infrastructure, using mathematical programming implemented in the Pyomo modelling framework. Additionally, dynamic modelling can be performed through the equation-oriented models in OpenModelica.

Please note that additional packages can be used to support spatial data processing and subsequent output mapping in QGIS. User manuals can be found in the respective directories for the software. 

The chain tool is available as free and open-source software under the MIT license. This is a permissive license that permits you to use the software for any purpose, as long as you just give credit where appropriate. However, the authors at ACT ELEGANCY kindly request that any useful modifications you make to the code be contributed back to us, so we can improve the tool over time.
